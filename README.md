# NBA_MVP
### âž­ Predicting the last 5 (2018-2022) NBA MVP's using Machine Learning. 

The Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given to the top-performing player of the regular season since the 1955-56 season. I use historical data surrounding an NBA player's basketball season to predict the last 5 MVPs (2018-2022).
My regression model correctly predicted all MVPs!
But what are the stats (features) that have allowed my model to perform so well?

The following picture shows all the work steps that are carried out. I usually combine these steps in a fully automated pipeline, but since this is a side project and my free time is limited, the pipeline is split into 3 files that are executed sequentially.

##### âž¤ 1 'nba_html_crawler.ipynb':
- Parse selected Basketball-Reference (Website) pages and save all relevant pages in html-format. 
- [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)

##### âž¤ 2 'nba_html_to_mongodb.ipynb':
- Aggregate the data from the html pages and upload it to my MongoDB Cloud account.

##### âž¤ 3 'nba_ml.ipynb':
- Predict the last 5 (2018-2022) NBA MVPs with Machine Learning.

##### âž¤ Additional 'dashboard.pbix': 
- PowerBI file with a three charts, all three are featured in the 'nba_ml.ipynb' file.

<br/>To my delight, I managed to predict all 5 MVPs using an XGBoost regressor. I was also able to use SHAP to examine the regressor's decision-making process. The two following diagrams show the results of the detailed model investigation. Since my time is limited, just a little hint on how to interpret the plots.

#### Hint 1/2 for both images: The feature with the greatest impact on the regressor is at the top. The feature, WS (= Win Share = is a metric that estimates the number of wins a player produces for his team throughout the season), is at the top. It follows that WS has the biggest influence on the regressor and its prediction.
#### Hint 2/2 for the second pictures: Here the individual features are now examined exactly according to their size.

#### The XGBoost will predict a higher mvp share score if...
- the feature 'WS' have a high value. -> (the number of wins a player produces for his team throughout the season)
- the feature 'WS/48' have a high value. -> (the number of wins a player produces for his team throughout the season aggregated in 48min, Game = 48min)
- the feature 'OBPM' have a high value. -> (the advanced Offensive Box Plus/Minus state show how good/valuable a player is for his team's offense)
- the feature 'Rk_Conference' have a low value. -> (the team has excelled performed in the regular season --> a low number in the conference: 1 from 15 teams)
